The anatomically-inspired Nike Air Max 95 Premium Women's Shoe retains its iconic look, but is sleeker, lighter and geared for 24/7 comfort and style. The Nike Air Max 95 features inspiration from the human body itself. The midsole represents the spine, graduated panels are the muscles, the lace loops are the shoeâ€™s ribs and the mesh upper is its skin. As a whole, they work together to propel you forward in style and comfort.",
